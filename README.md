# react-controllable-animation-generator

[www.react-controllable-animation.com](http://www.react-controllable-animation.com)

An application that generates valid spreadsheets and description language from gif animations to easily create a [react-controllable-animation](https://github.com/CalvinNolan/react-controllable-animation).

## Generating spritesheets and language with the app

Spritesheets are downloaded as a png file and support transparency. The description language is downloaded as a json file.

Requirements to download the files are to have added at least one animation and to fill out the overall controllable title name and default frame.

When adding an individual animation you're required to input a name and select a gif animation for it and have the option to select a climax frame.

Check out the docs for [react-controllable-animation](https://github.com/CalvinNolan/react-controllable-animation) to understand what these inputs represent for a controllable animation.

## Installation

The application is hosted at [www.react-controllable-animation-generator.com](http://www.react-controllable-animation.com) for quick use.

If you want to run is locally firstly ensure you have [Node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/), then run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.
